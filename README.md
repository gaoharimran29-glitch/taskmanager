# 📝 **Task Manager (Python)**

A simple **Task Manager program in Python** that lets you add, update, delete, and view your daily tasks using a menu-driven interface.

---

## 🚀 **Features**
- **Add** new tasks  
- **Update** existing tasks  
- **Delete** tasks  
- **View** all tasks  
- **Exit** program safely  

---

## 🛠️ **How It Works**
1. At the start, the program asks you how many tasks you want to add initially.  
2. It stores all tasks inside a Python list (`alltask`).  
3. You’ll see a menu with options:  
   - `1 → Add` a new task  
   - `2 → Update` an existing task  
   - `3 → Delete` a task  
   - `4 → View` all tasks  
   - `5 → Exit` the program

## 📋 **Example Usage**
```bash
-------TASK MANAGER--------
Enter no. of tasks you want: 2
Enter task: Study
Enter task: Exercise
Your today's tasks:  ['Study', 'Exercise']

1. Add
2. Update
3. Delete
4. View
5. Exit/stop
Enter choice: 1
Enter the task you want to add: Shopping
Task successfully added....
```

## 🖥️ **Requirements**
- Python 3.x  

No external libraries are needed — just built-in Python functions.

---

## ▶️ **Run the Program**
1. Save the code into a file called `task_manager.py`  
2. Run it in terminal/command prompt:  
   ```bash
   python task_manager.py
   ```

## 🔮 **Possible Improvements**
- Add due dates for tasks  
- Mark tasks as completed  
- Save tasks permanently in a file (e.g., `.txt` or `.json`)  
- Create a GUI version with Tkinter or PyQt
